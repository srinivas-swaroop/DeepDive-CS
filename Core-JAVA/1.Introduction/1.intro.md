Nice 🚀 Let’s start with **Java-Core → Introduction.md** content.
Since you want *detailed explanation of Java and its versions* (with what’s added + differences), here’s a structured draft you can use in your repo.

# 📘 Introduction to Java

## 1. What is Java?

* **Java** is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by **James Gosling at Sun Microsystems** (released in 1995).
* It is designed with the principle: **“Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”** – meaning compiled bytecode can run on any machine having a **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**.

### Key Features of Java

* Object-Oriented
* Platform Independent (JVM based)
* Robust & Secure
* Multithreaded
* High Performance (with JIT compiler)
* Rich API & Strong Community Support

## 2. Evolution of Java Versions

Here’s a detailed breakdown of major Java versions and their contributions:

### 🔹 **JDK 1.0 (1996)**

* Initial release by Sun Microsystems.
* Features: Applets, AWT, Basic OOP, Virtual Machine.
* Very limited libraries compared to now.

### 🔹 **JDK 1.2 (1998) – Java 2**

* Introduced **Swing** (better GUI than AWT).
* Collections Framework.
* JIT Compiler for better performance.

### 🔹 **JDK 1.5 (2004) – Java 5**

* Major upgrade (often called "Tiger").
* Added **Generics**, **Annotations**, **Enum types**, **Varargs**, **Autoboxing/Unboxing**.
* Enhanced for-each loop.

### 🔹 **Java SE 6 (2006)**

* Focused on web services & scripting (JSR 223).
* Improvements in JVM, GUI, and performance.
* JDBC 4.0 API introduced.

### 🔹 **Java SE 7 (2011)**

* Project "Coin": small language changes like **try-with-resources**, binary literals, underscores in numeric literals, switch with Strings.
* Fork/Join framework for parallelism.

### 🔹 **Java SE 8 (2014)**

⚡ Biggest shift since Java 5.

* **Lambda Expressions** (Functional Programming).
* **Stream API** for collections.
* **Default & Static methods** in interfaces.
* New **Date & Time API (java.time)**.

### 🔹 **Java SE 9 (2017)**

* **Modules (Project Jigsaw)** → modular programming.
* JShell (REPL) for quick testing.
* Improved JDK documentation.

### 🔹 **Java SE 10 (2018)**

* Local variable type inference with `var`.

### 🔹 **Java SE 11 (2018) – LTS**

* Removed Java EE and CORBA.
* Introduced new `HttpClient` API.
* String methods: `isBlank()`, `lines()`, `strip()`, etc.

### 🔹 **Java SE 14 (2020)**

* **Switch Expressions** (finalized).
* Records (preview).
* Pattern Matching for `instanceof`.

### 🔹 **Java SE 17 (2021) – LTS**

* Sealed Classes.
* Strong encapsulation of JDK internals.
* Pattern Matching for `switch` (preview).
* New macOS rendering pipeline.

### 🔹 **Java SE 21 (2023) – LTS**

* Virtual Threads (Project Loom) → lightweight concurrency.
* Sequenced Collections.
* String Templates (preview).
* Record Patterns.
