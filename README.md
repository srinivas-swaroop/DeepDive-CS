## âœ… Best Way to Use This Repo

1. **Start with Java Core** â€“ get a strong foundation in programming and OOP.
2. **Move to DBMS** â€“ learn how data is stored and managed.
3. **Learn CN & OS** â€“ understand how computers communicate and how systems manage resources.
4. **Finally, dive into DSA** â€“ strengthen problem-solving and prepare for coding interviews.
