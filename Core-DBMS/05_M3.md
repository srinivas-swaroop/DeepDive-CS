Perfect 🚀 — you’ve now reached a **core topic in DBMS** that’s **heavily tested in GATE** and also very relevant in **placements** when normalization and schema design come up.
Let’s go step by step.

# 📌 Cover, Equivalence of FD, Canonical Cover, Key Generation

---

## 1. **Concept / Theory (Clear & Intuitive)**

### 🔹 Functional Dependency (FD) Cover

* A **cover** of a set of FDs **F** is just **another set of FDs G such that F ≡ G** (i.e., F and G imply the same constraints).
* Multiple covers possible, but we want the simplest one → **Canonical Cover**.

---

### 🔹 Equivalence of FD Sets

* Two sets of FDs **F** and **G** are **equivalent** if:

  1. Every FD in **F** can be inferred from **G**.
  2. Every FD in **G** can be inferred from **F**.
* Practically: F⁺ = G⁺ (closures are the same).

---

### 🔹 Canonical Cover (a.k.a. Minimal Cover)

* A **canonical cover Fc** of F is a *minimal equivalent set of FDs*.
* Rules:

  1. **RHS Single Attribute** → split A → BC into A → B and A → C.
  2. **Remove Extraneous Attributes from LHS**: If A → B, check if any attribute in A is redundant.
  3. **Remove Redundant Dependencies**: If an FD can be inferred from others, drop it.

👉 Why needed?

* For **normalization** (3NF, BCNF) we don’t want extra/duplicate FDs.
* For **efficient design**, simpler dependencies → easier schema decomposition.

---

### 🔹 Key Generation

* **Superkey** = set of attributes whose closure includes all attributes.
* **Candidate key** = minimal superkey.
* Process = Compute **attribute closure** under canonical cover.

---

## 2. **Examples (Simple + Tricky)**

---

✅ **Example 1: Simple Canonical Cover**
F = { A → BC, B → C, A → B, AB → C }

Step 1: RHS split
\= { A → B, A → C, B → C, AB → C }

Step 2: Remove extraneous LHS attributes

* AB → C: But A → C already exists → redundant.
  \= { A → B, A → C, B → C }

Step 3: Remove redundant dependencies

* A → C can be inferred from A → B and B → C → redundant.
  \= { A → B, B → C }

👉 Canonical Cover Fc = { A → B, B → C }

---

✅ **Example 2: Equivalence Check**
F1 = { A → B, B → C }
F2 = { A → B, A → C }

Check:

* From F1: A → B, and B → C ⇒ A → C (yes)
* From F2: A → B is explicit, A → C is explicit ⇒ implies F1 as well
  👉 F1 ≡ F2

---

✅ **Example 3: Key Generation**
R(A, B, C, D), F = { A → B, B → C }

Check closures:

* A⁺ = {A, B, C} (not full)
* AD⁺ = {A, B, C, D} ✅ candidate key
* ACD⁺, ABD⁺ also superkeys but not minimal
  👉 Candidate key = {AD}

---

## 3. **Edge Cases / Common Pitfalls**

* Forgetting to **split RHS** (canonical cover requires single attribute).
* Missing **extraneous attribute removal** (like AB → C when A → C exists).
* Assuming F1 and F2 are equivalent just because they "look similar" → must check closure.
* Thinking candidate key = just "non-RHS attributes" → only works in some cases, not always.

---

## 4. **GATE Perspective 🎯**

* **Typical Questions**:

  * “Find canonical cover of given FD set.”
  * “Check if two FD sets are equivalent.”
  * “Number of candidate keys?”
  * “Which decomposition is dependency-preserving/lossless?”

* **Formulas/Steps to Memorize**:

  * Closure algorithm (O(|F| × |R|)).
  * Extraneous attribute test:

    * For FD X → A, check if (X−{x})⁺ under F still contains A. If yes → x is extraneous.

* **Common Traps**:

  * They give large FD sets; skipping systematic splitting/reduction leads to mistakes.
  * Forgetting dependency preservation check when asked about normalization.

---

## 5. **Placement Perspective 💼**

* **Interview relevance**:

  * You may be asked: *“Why do we need canonical cover?”*
    👉 Answer: To avoid redundancy in FDs, ensure simpler schema design, and support dependency-preserving normalization.
  * SQL relevance: In practice, DBMS automatically ensures minimal constraints when defining PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, but theory is essential.
* Quick answer:

  * Cover = equivalent FD set.
  * Canonical cover = minimal FD set (RHS single attribute, no extraneous LHS/RHS).
  * Candidate key = minimal superkey found by closure.

---

## 6. **Comparison with Related Concepts**

* **Cover vs Canonical Cover**:

  * Cover = any equivalent FD set.
  * Canonical Cover = *minimal* equivalent set.

* **FD Closure vs Attribute Closure**:

  * FD Closure (F⁺): all FDs derivable.
  * Attribute Closure (X⁺): all attributes derivable from X.

* **Superkey vs Candidate Key**:

  * Superkey = not necessarily minimal.
  * Candidate key = minimal superkey.

---

## 7. **Final Quick Summary for Revision**

* **Cover**: Any equivalent FD set.
* **Equivalence**: F ≡ G ⇔ F⁺ = G⁺.
* **Canonical Cover**:

  1. Split RHS.
  2. Remove extraneous attributes from LHS.
  3. Remove redundant dependencies.
* **Key Generation**:

  * Compute closures → superkeys → minimize → candidate keys.
* **GATE trap**: Forgetting minimality or redundancy check.
* **Placement answer**: Canonical cover = simplest FD set ensuring same constraints. Candidate key = minimal unique identifier for tuples.

Here’s a curated list of **GATE CSE (2007–2025) questions** focusing on these key DBMS topics:

### GATE CSE DBMS PYQs: Canonical Cover, Equivalence, Key Generation

---

#### 1. **GATE CSE 2017 – Finding Minimal (Irreducible) Cover**

* **Year**: 2017
* **Topic**: Canonical Cover (Minimal Cover)
* **Question**: Given FDs on R{V, W, X, Y, Z}:

  ```
  V → W  
  VW → X  
  Y → VX  
  Y → Z
  ```

  Which of the following is the irreducible equivalent set?

  * **Options** include dependencies like V→W, V→X, W→X, Y→V, Y→Z, etc.
  * **Answer**:

    ```
    V → W  
    V → X  
    Y → V  
    Y → Z
    ```

  Explanation: VW → X is replaced with V → X (since V+ already contains X), and Y → VX is split/minimized accordingly. ([Testbook][1])

---

#### 2. **GATE CSE 2014 – Minimal Cover Identification**

* **Year**: 2014
* **Topic**: Minimal Cover
* **Statements**:

  * **S1**: Every 2-attribute table is in all normal forms.
  * **S2**: `{AB → C, D → E, E → C}` is a minimal cover for `{AB → C, D → E, AB → E, E → C}`.
* **Correct Answer**: S2 is correct; S1 is not.
  This demonstrates usage of minimal cover concepts to simplify FD sets. ([ExamSIDE][2])

---

#### 3. **GATE CSE 2005–2008 – Candidate Key Identification**

* **Year**: 2005 (and others around that period)

* **Topic**: Key Generation (Finding Candidate Keys)

* **Example (2005)**:
  Relation R(A, B, C, D, E) with:

  ```
  A → B  
  A → C  
  CD → E  
  B → D  
  E → A
  ```

  Which FD is **not implied**?
  While the exact options weren't listed, this setup tests closure for key inference and checking implied FDs. ([ExamSIDE][3])

* **Year**: 1995
  Example: Relation R with FDs where candidate keys are directly identified as AB and BC. ([GATE Overflow for GATE CSE][4])

### What You Should Focus On (GATE Perspective)

* **Canonical Cover Steps**:

  1. Split RHS
  2. Remove extraneous LHS attributes
  3. Remove redundant FDs

* **Equivalence**: Two FD sets are equivalent if each’s closure contains the other’s dependencies.

* **Key Generation**:

  * Compute attribute closure.
  * Identify superkeys whose closure covers all attributes.
  * Minimize to get candidate keys.
  * Remember: There can be **multiple candidate keys**.

* **Typical Pitfalls**:

  * Skip splitting FDs with multiple RHS attributes.
  * Forget to check extraneous attributes that weaken LHS.
  * Confuse superkeys with minimal candidate keys.
  * Miss multiple candidate keys hidden in closure tests.
